### What I learned

If you are not a designer, it is important that learn 
the basics of User Interface and User experience. Doing this
helped me to trained myself using design tool such as Figma
and designer-development tool with Webflow. 

Today, I heard this:"Do not delete revisions or hide it, because the revisions show your growth." 
I decided that instead of releasing a "perfect" first draft but to show my revisions as I learn and practice.
